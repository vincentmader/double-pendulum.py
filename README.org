* Double Pendulum Integrator & Visualization

In this small python project, the equations of motion 
of a double pendulum were integrated using a fourth 
order Runge-Kutta scheme. The results were visualized 
via the `pygame` library.                                                                    

A demonstration can also be seen [[https://youtu.be/H_trgmAk5kY][here]] on YouTube.

To try it out, you need to have `python3` installed on your machine. 

If you also have the `make` CLI tool, you can run the 
project by executing the following two commands:
From your shell, run
#+begin_src
make setup
make pendulum
#+end_src

If you don't, you can also navigate to the `./bin/` 
directory and execute the two binaries manually from there.
